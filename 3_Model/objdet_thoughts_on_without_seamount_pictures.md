1. Handling Images with No Seamount (Empty Bounding Boxes)

If there are images in the dataset that do not contain a seamount, the ground truth bounding box for such images would ideally be [0, 0, 0, 0], representing no object. In such cases:

    The model should learn to predict [0, 0, 0, 0] for images that do not contain a seamount.
    You could make sure that such cases are properly represented in your dataset by ensuring that non-object images have their bounding boxes set to [0, 0, 0, 0].

2. Loss Function Considerations (Huber Loss)

In the current setup, the model is using Huber Loss, which is a common loss function for regression tasks. When the ground truth bounding box for an image without an object is [0, 0, 0, 0], the loss should be small if the predicted bounding box is also [0, 0, 0, 0], since the error between the predicted and true bounding box is minimal. However, if the model predicts a non-zero bounding box, the loss would be larger, leading to a penalty.

This means that if an image without a seamount gets an incorrect prediction (e.g., predicting a bounding box where no object exists), the model would get penalized for it. This would ideally guide the model to learn that for certain images (those without objects), it should predict [0, 0, 0, 0].
